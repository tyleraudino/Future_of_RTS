# Future_of_RTS
Identifying the Future of Gainesville's Regional Transit System (RTS)
Final project by Tyler Audino for GIS3043C in Spring 2023 with professor Anwar Sounny-Slitine.
All data analysis was performed and all graphics were developed in ArcGIS Pro.


This project was developed in response to the lack of reliable public transportation in Gainesville, FL. The analysis performed aimed to identify areas that were most in need of new bus stops, based on income, food-inequality, and geospatial RTS data. Conditional testing and buffer analysis were performed to propose strategic placement of 42 new bus stops, where 46.7% of these stops were located in food deserts.
